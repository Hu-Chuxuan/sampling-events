# sampling-events

This is a starter task repo for sampling events.

Two sampling techniques are implemented in the **algorithm.py** file: bootstrap and hoeffding inequality based approach. Events are generated in the **gen.py** file.

To run tests, type

```bat
python test.py
```
in command prompt.

We can observe that:

1. As the user-defined error target and/or CI get larger, the average error rates of hoeffding based approach increases due to less samples.

2. As CI gets larger, the interval generated by bootstrap also increases.

Both align with theoretical analysis.
